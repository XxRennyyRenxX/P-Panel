# **P-Panel | Palword Server Admin Panel**

I found there's many flaws in hosting a dedicated server, for Xbox Palworld. One of them being, no admin management without someone having someone a capable PC that can run Palworld. This is partly due, to being unable to run admin commands on console, due to their being no physical way to open the chatbox. 

This program is lightweight requires no extreme hardware requiremenents , and there is currently no GUI interface for the program itself, which i will be working on in the future. For now however, this is a simple Python script, that allows you to access your server via the servers **RestAPI**. 

Using RestAPI you can utilize the Admin Panel to 



## Usages

- Display Server Info 
- Get a list of Players, and see Individual Players Information
- See the Server Settings (Settings cannot be changed from the Admin Panel)
- Send Announcements (Will not Display on Console)
- Kick Players
- Ban Players
- Unban Players
- Save the World State
- Shutdown the Server with a Message to players
- Force Stop the Server 




## Acknowledgements

This could not be achieved without the Official PalWorld API, so please do check it out, if you wish to understand more how this program was achieved.

That said as well, this also could not of been achieved without *dkoz*'s Palworld API Wraper for python, their hard work into their wrapper, has made me developing this program a lot more easier, rather than having to develop my own wrapper. So credits go to them. You check their github project out here
